COP 3530 Project
Introduction:
For this project, you will come up with your idea of a problem that can benefit from the use of one of the data structures we have covered in class. The topic can be anything up to your imagination.

We are providing the structure of the project; this will allow us to run tests on your files. Follow the link to get set up.

The sky is the limit, use your imagination. For example, create a graph data structure to plot a path in a city or town. Create a game that uses an advanced data structure. Etc.

All the team members will submit all the code on their personal assignments. All team members' names should be on the document comments and include each member's contribution in a "Contribution" section.

Link:

Deadline:
You will submit an idea and proposal by Friday, March 31st.

The final deadline is the last week of class, before 4/21/23. Late submittals will slow down the whole class grade.

Grading:
We will grade mostly on effort. Low production will result in a poor grade, on the other hand, a big effort can net you a 25% extra credit on the 20% that the project represents. Therefore, extra credit is 5% of the total grade for the course.

How to quantify effort?

We will review for code that is well-documented and neat.
The number of actual files exceeds 10 at least. Each main class should reside on its own file.
The use of interfaces and inheritance throughout.
The use of data structures covered in class, the more the better.
The applicability of the tool.
The actual presentation of the output.
A good use of GitHub to collaborate with your group members.
I will penalize:

Copy Pasting code, either from Web or ChatGPT. You can use them as tools to learn and get small pieces but write your own.
Low effort, barely handling one data structure.
Late submittal, extensions.
No communication between group members, if you are having issues, tell me before the deadline.
Advice
First, get started immediately, of course. Don't just jump in and code, though. Make sure you understand the specifications (which have their subtleties) and plan out how you're going to meet them.

Figure out how to break your problem down into small pieces, and how to implement and test them one piece at a time. Know in detail how you're going to do something before writing a line of Java code for it.

Work with your partner to bounce ideas and solve problems. Then split your tasks and each one does a part and you combine later the results. (similar to Quicksort!)
